					<p>
					We and our service providers use cookies, beacons, embedded scripts and local shared objects in connection with the Sites.
					</p>
					<ul class="privacy_numbers m_none">
						<li>
							<span class="t_bold_font">• Cookies</span> are small text files that are stored on your computer or device when you visit our websites. Cookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser. The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect information about visitors’ activities while using the website.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="t_bold_font">• Beacons</span> are small graphical images (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) that may be included on our Sites and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="t_bold_font">• </span> An <span class="t_bold_font">embedded script</span> is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="t_bold_font">• Local Shared Objects.</span> Local shared objects (or Flash cookies) are pieces of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user’s computer or device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use local shared objects. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing local shared objects. In addition, you may manage Flash cookies by clicking here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" class="underline wrap">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					The above technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Sites, services and products, tracking users’ movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
					</p>
					<p>
					We use cookies to remember users’ settings, market products and services to users, and for authentication purposes. To manage the cookies that are placed on your computer, you may configure your internet browser to refuse, accept or delete cookies from our Sites at any time.  The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Please note that if cookies are disabled or removed, not all features of our Sites will operate as intended.
					</p>
					<p>
					<span class="t_bold_font">Third-Party Advertising Services:</span> We partner with third parties that may use technologies such as cookies (and local stored objects as described above) to gather information about your activities on the Sites and elsewhere on the Internet in order to provide you with relevant advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. This type of advertising is sometimes called interest-based advertising.  If you wish to not have this information collected and used for interest-based advertising, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=truste01&aid=preference_manager01&type=public" class="underline">here</a> for partners that participate in the TRUSTe opt-out tool (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" class="underline">here</a>).  If you wish to opt-out from this type of advertising for companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), you can do so <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" class="underline">here</a>.

					<span class="t_bold_font">Security and Retention.</span> We take commercially reasonable steps to help protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from a Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to us or to any other party via the Internet. The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms or login credentials (such as username and password) on our platform login, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Your Personal Information will be stored in the United States and will be subject to laws applicable in that country.  If you have any questions about security on our Sites, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@meltsunglasses.com" class="t_blue">customerservice@meltsunglasses.com</a>.
